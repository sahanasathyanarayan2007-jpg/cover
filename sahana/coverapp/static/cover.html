            This book <span class="highlight">A Different Look At Artifical Intelligence</span>
            Artificial Intelligence is like a mirror for human creativity.
             Instead of thinking on its own, it reflects the ideas, 
             patterns, and possibilities we feed into it.
              The more we shape it, the more it reshapes how we work, 
              learn, and imagine the future.
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
            AI is not replacing human intelligence; it is revealing
             how much more we can create when imagination meets computation.
